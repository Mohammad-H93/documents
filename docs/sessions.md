# What is a Session?

## Sessions and the Design Process

The Termite Dashboard organizes work into **sessions**.

A session represents a **specific step in the design process** and acts as a shared project space between the Termite Dashboard and your CAD software.

Plugins in Rhino and Revit read from and sync with sessions **in both directions**, keeping geometry and design information aligned at all times.

## Generate Your First Session

The current session type focuses on **plan generation** through an interactive interface.

Within a session, architects can generate layouts for **any building typology** based on a **custom physical program**. These layouts respond to both design intent and spatial constraints synced from CAD. 

Check out a short video on how to generate a new session:

## Physical Programs

A **physical program** defines the spatial logic of a project — such as room types, sizes, relationships, and constraints.

Termite provides a wide category of predefined spaces that you can:
- Use as a starting point
- Combine into your own templates
- Customize to fit specific project needs

Check out a short video on using template spaces:

  frameborder="0"
  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
  allowfullscreen>

Each space type can include common regulations such as:
- Minimum and maximum area
- Daylight requirements
- Shape constraints
- Minimum width

You are always free to **adjust or override these values** based on your own design preferences and project goals.

## Reusable Templates

Physical program templates:
- Can be reused across multiple projects
- Can be edited and refined over time
- Enable consistent, repeatable design logic

This makes it easy to maintain design standards while still allowing flexibility in each new session.
