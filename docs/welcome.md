# What is Termite?

**Termite** is an AI-powered design assistant that helps architects during the **early design phase** by generating standard architectural plans through an interactive interface.

Termite synchronizes with local CAD software to read geometries and design constraints, allowing architects to explore layout variations while staying connected to their existing design tools and workflows.

---

## How Termite Works

Termite connects to your local CAD environment (such as Rhino or Revit) through plugins and synchronizes geometry, boundaries, and constraints with the **Termite Cloud Dashboard**.

Through an interactive AI-powered interface, Termite:
- Reads spatial inputs and design intentions
- Processes custom physical programs
- Generates plan layouts that can be reviewed, refined, and exported back into CAD or BIM environments

Alongside the dashboard, Termite also provides **API services** and **dedicated consultancy** to support custom AI-driven design workflows.

## A Brief History

Termite has been designed and developed since **2020**.

- Started as **Termite Nest**, a Grasshopper plugin
- Reached over **6,000 downloads**
- Evolved through extensive community feedback
- Became a full **intelligent design assistant dashboard in 2025**

This evolution reflects a strong focus on real architectural workflows and practical usability.

##  Features

### Sync and Generate
Within a session, you can synchronize Termite with your CAD software to:
- Define site boundaries
- Set preferred locations
- Specify fixed or restricted geometries

Termite AI then generates multiple layout variations based on these inputs.

---

### Easy Draft
Select a generated layout and refine it directly:
- Add or trim walls
- Place doors and windows
- Adjust space quality and proportions

All refinements are performed quickly and intuitively, supporting fast iteration.

---

### Layered Export
Generated plans can be exported with structured layers including:
- Walls
- Doors
- Windows
- Space boundaries

These layered outputs can be seamlessly imported into your CAD software and aligned with synchronized locations.

---

### Live Update
Modify the building outline or individual spaces directly in your CAD software and see the impact on layout generation **in real time**.

This enables a continuous feedback loop between geometry and AI-generated layouts.

---

### BIM Model Export
Plans can be exported as **native Revit BIM models**.

Using the Termite Revit plugin:
- Wall, window, and door types are synced from Revit
- Termite loads the plan using your predefined BIM settings
- Each space is assigned appropriate building elements automatically

---

## API and Custom Workflows

### Layout API
Termite provides a **Layout API** that allows teams to build custom AI-driven workflows.

Through API access and consultancy services, Termite supports:
- Custom integrations
- Automated layout generation
- Tailored AI design pipelines for specific practices

---

## Upcoming Features

### Planning Design Code Verify *(Coming Soon)*
Upload local municipality design code documents and let Termite:
- Parse regulatory requirements
- Cross-verify generated plan geometry
- Assist with compliance checking

---

### Eco Layer *(Coming Soon)*
Apply default or custom materials to:
- Walls
- Windows
- Ceilings
- Roofing
- HVAC systems

The Termite design assistant will:
- Assign intelligent data layers to geometry
- Automate energy-related calculations
- Support early sustainability evaluation

---

## Who Termite Is For

Termite is built for architects who want to:
- Accelerate early-stage design
- Explore layout alternatives efficiently
- Stay connected to Rhino and Revit
- Integrate AI without disrupting existing workflows
