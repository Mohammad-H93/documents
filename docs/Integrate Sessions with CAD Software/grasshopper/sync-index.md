# Sync a Termite Session with Grasshopper
## How Sessions Work with Plugins

- Sessions are **created and managed** in the Termite Dashboard
- Grasshopper plugin **syncs geometry and information** to the active session
- Changes made in Grasshopper or in the dashboard are reflected across the session

A session becomes the **single source of truth** for your project during early design.

Check out a short video on how to sync a Termite session with Grasshopper:

  frameborder="0"
  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
  allowfullscreen>

By refreshing, you can see the last generated layout of the session.

## Setting Inputs in Grasshopper

- Sessions get inputs from the **Grasshopper**
- These inputs include a **boundary curve, preferred locations for spaces, fixed spaces**

---
### Defining Boundary Curves
To start with a layout generation, you need to define a boundary.


Check out a short video on how to insert a **boundary** in Grasshopper and sync it with a Termite session:

  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
  allowfullscreen>

Make sure that the selected boundary is a **closed curve**.

### Defining Preferred Space Locations
You can specify the locations of the spaces inside your boundary.

### Defining Fixed Spaces
You can define the shape of some spaces in a layout by defining them as **fixed spaces**.

Check out a short video on how to insert **fixed spaces** in Grasshopper and sync it with a Termite session:
