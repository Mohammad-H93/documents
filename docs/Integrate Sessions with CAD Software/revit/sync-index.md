# Sync a Termite Session with Revit
## How Sessions Work with Plugins

- Sessions are **created and managed** in the Termite Dashboard
- Revit plugin **syncs geometry and information** to the active session
- Changes made in Revit or in the dashboard are reflected across the session

A session becomes the **single source of truth** for your project during early design.

You can also set settings for wall types, door sizes, etc.

## Setting Inputs in Revit

- Sessions get inputs from the **Revit**
- These inputs include a **boundary curve, preferred locations for spaces, fixed spaces**

### Defining Boundary Curves
To start with a layout generation, you need to define a boundary.

Check out a short video on how to insert a **boundary** in Revit and sync it with a Termite session:

Make sure that the selected boundary is a **closed curve**.

### Defining Preferred Space Locations
You can specify the locations of the spaces inside your boundary.

Check out a short video on how to insert **preferred locations for spaces** in Revit and sync it with a Termite session:

### Defining Fixed Spaces
You can define the shape of some spaces in a layout by defining them as **fixed spaces**.

In Revit, fixed spaces can be defined using two methods: (1) with lines, (2) with rooms.

Check out a short video on how to insert **fixed spaces** in Revit and sync it with a Termite session:

### Defining Axes
You can define one or more axes in Revit and ask Termite to align spaces based on those axes.
