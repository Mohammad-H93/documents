# Sync a Termite Session with Rhino
## How Sessions Work with Plugins

- Sessions are **created and managed** in the Termite Dashboard
- Rhino plugin **syncs geometry and information** to the active session
- Changes made in Rhino or in the dashboard are reflected across the session

A session becomes the **single source of truth** for your project during early design.

## Setting Inputs in Rhino

- Sessions get inputs from the **Rhino**
- These inputs include a **boundary curve, preferred locations for spaces, fixed spaces**

### Defining Boundary Curves
To start with a layout generation, you need to define a boundary.

Check out a short video on how to insert a **boundary** in Rhino and sync it with a Termite session:

Make sure that the selected boundary is a **closed curve**.

### Defining Preferred Space Locations
You can specify the locations of the spaces inside your boundary.

### Defining Fixed Spaces
You can define the shape of some spaces in a layout by defining them as **fixed spaces**.
